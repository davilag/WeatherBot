# WeatherBot
Telegram bot to notify notify users every morning the weather in a location (potentially their current location)

##Add dependencies
To add new dependencies to the project, just add the name of the dependency in the `requirements.txt` file. You can add this dependency using specifying the version number or just the name:
```
telepot==10.3
requests
```

##Build the project
In order to add all the project dependencies, we have to run the `build.sh` script. We may need to run it with `sudo` permissions.
